# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Stock
This project is a Python application for performing Monte Carlo simulations to analyze stock performances, not limited to any specific company. It uses historical closing price data to generate optimistic and pessimistic forecasts for stock prices based on statistical simulations.
# Features
Employs yfinance to download historical data for any stock.
Calculates daily returns, moments, and trends of closing prices.
Generates line graphs and histograms for data visualization.
Conducts 50 Monte Carlo simulations to predict optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for stock prices.
# Requirements
Requires Python with yfinance, numpy, matplotlib, and statistics libraries installed.
# Usage
The script will:

Download historical stock data.
Calculate and display relevant statistics.
Generate and display graphs for data analysis.
Perform Monte Carlo simulations and show optimistic and pessimistic forecasts.
